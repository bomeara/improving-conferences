Career Fair for graduate and postdoctoral trainees on job search 2. Junior Principal Investigator Sessions: A.How to outline an individualized career development plan to become a successful PI(This session will cover the concept of having an active role on your own career development and empowering trainees to have a strategy when picking mentors and pursuing training. This encompasses making very conscious decisions about what your niche or "brand" will be when looking for jobs (academic or not). Having an "IDP" is a requirement for all NIH grants on the "training" phases and it is also being requested by private foundations.)   B.Climbing the grant ladder: The importance of establishing a record of funding early in your career(Grantsmanship has a (steep) learning curve and the earlier you start to climb the better you will be by the time you really need to get funded. Starting a position with funding makes you extremely attractive in a job search, and it used to be exceptional but it is slowly becoming the norm. This session will go through the typical grant ladders available in the US and in Europe and provide tips on how to climb and how to help your trainees begin their journey.) C.Strategies to generate data: wet-lab, collaborations and consortia(As a computational person, having your own wetlab can be extremely beneficial providing you with experimental control and access to additional funding. However, is it wise to venture outside your area of expertise? Or is it better to rely on collaborations? How do you go about supervising PhDs in the wetlab if you have no experience yourself?)  Consortium projects can help you do bigger and better science. However, getting the most out of participation in a consortium and coming out on top can be difficult. D.How to get involved in the ISCB as a PI(The ISCB has expressed a desire to further engage senior postdocs and principal investigators in the society. In this session we will find out ways in which participants can become more active within the society.)   (How do you hire the best staff? How do you get tenure? What if you don’t get tenure? How do you manage a budget? How much admin should I do? How much should you travel? How do you motivate lab members? These questions and many more will be discussed amongst participants and each will share their secrets on what has worked best. This will be achieved through structured round table conversations amongst participants with the speakers.)	ISCB Student Council (https://www.iscbsc.org/) aim to promote the caree development of young computational biologists through their events. The Student Council conducts coordinated ECR events with ISCB-related events (ISMB, ECCB, ASBCB, ISCB-LA), such as the Student Council Symposium (SCS), European Student Council Symposium (ESCS), Student Council Symposium - Latin America (LA-SCS) and Student Council Symposium - Africa (SCS Africa).

None	No App but instruction were provided on conference website(Safety – Crime Copenhagen remains a relatively safe, secure city. However, use of common sense is (always) required, as in any large city. Experience has shown that some basic precautionary measures should always be kept in mind in any city: – Do not carry important items like flight tickets, passports etc. with you when visiting the conference or strolling through the city, leave them in the hotel safe during your stay. Rather carry a Xerox copy of your passport or an identity card with you. – Try not to carry all documents, money, credit cards and other essential items and valuables in one bag or purse. If it is lost or stolen, everything will be gone and might be difficult to replace on short notice, especially passports and visa to return to your country of residence. – Take off your name badge when leaving the conference centre. – In heavily frequented tourist zones and the metro at rush hour, be aware of attemps of scam and pickpocketing. – Do not respond to anybody unknown to you who comes up to you on the street engaging you in a conversation, no matter how safe they appear to be.

The sleeping area is equipped with cots for children up to five years old. The play and activity area is equipped with toys and books for different age categories, a lounge/relaxation corner with big pillows and a TV with DVD player, play mats, baby rockers and a small table and stools for art and craft activities.

Tante Marloes childcare services include a daily programme with arts and crafts, group games, music and movement, board games, story time and dramatic play.  Food and drink Food and snacks will not be provided as part of the childcare services. Parents/guardians can provide necessary food. The nannies will give the child only food and snacks provided by the parent/guardian. A water dispenser will be available in the childcare area. If parents/guardians want to bring any other drink, they can provide the drink and the nannies will give it to the child.  Health Insurance Parents/guardians are required to have their own medical insurance which fully covers their child, including any medical or hospitalization expenses, repatriation in case of medical emergency, accident causing permanent disability or death.  Liability Insurance The parents/guardians will be responsible for any damage caused by their children at all times. The parents/guardians’ liability insurance shall include the coverage for all damages to personal belongings by their child’s own carelessness or negligence (for example, a child stumbles and shatters his or another child’s spectacles, or a child damages her own or another child’s clothes), loss of personal belongings and theft of belongings.  Liability Except gross negligence or willful misconduct, the International AIDS Society and Tante Marloes, the selected childcare provider, shall not be liable for any damage caused. The parent/guardian agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the International AIDS Society and Tante Marloes harmless from and against any and all liability, loss and expense (including attorney’s fees) or any claims arising out of or resulting from its activity and caused by their child. How to book Childcare Services for your Accompanying Child(ren)  Parents/guardians must have submitted the childcare booking form before the 6 July 2018. Childcare booking is not complete until receipt of a written confirmation email stating that the booking has been accepted. Confirmations are sent by email within 4 days of receipt of booking. Parents/guardians will receive a final email from the childcare provider beginning of July 2018, asking to reconfirm their child’s attendance at the childcare services. Parents/guardians must reply to this email within four days. No reply in due time will lead to the childcare booking being cancelled.  Please note In order to have access to the childcare service, the child must be registered as an “accompanying child” for the conference at the applicable registration fee and in accordance with the Terms and Conditions for delegates. In addition, the parent/guardian consent form must be completed for each accompanying child and submitted to the AIDS 2018 Registration Department. Children without an “accompanying children” registration and name badge will not be given access to the conference area, and will therefore not have access to the childcare room.  Additional information It is the parent/guardian’s responsibility to provide all important information related to the child (including allergies and health conditions) when submitting the childcare booking form, and to remind the caregiver on site when checking the child in at the childcare room. For children with special needs, the childcare service provider reserves the right to not accept the application, based on the capacity of the childcare services, on a case-by-case basis. The childcare services will not administer any prescription medicine to the children. Parents/guardians must return to the childcare facility to dispense any medicine to their child. For the health of other children in care, sick children will not be allowed into the childcare facility. Parents/guardians must label all clothes and toys brought to the childcare room with the child’s name. No valuable items can be left with the child in the childcare facility. Parents/guardians must provide a contact number where he/she can be reached at any time while the child is in the childcare room. Parents/guardians shall be available at any time to collect their child in the childcare room in case any problem occurs while their child is being cared for. Parents/guardians or persons authorized by the parents/guardians to check child(ren) in and out need to bring their passport or other ID.

With our Grants for Carers, you can apply for up to £1,000 per year to help you attend a chemistry-related meeting, conference or workshop or a professional development event. This money would be used to cover any additional costs you incur, paying for care that you usually provide.  Each application will be assessed on its own merits Every carer's responsibilities are different, so we are committed to assessing each application individually. However, by way of guidance, the kinds of expenses that we will consider funding include:      extra home help or nursing care for a dependant whilst you will not be present     additional medical/respite care for a dependant whilst you will not be present     travel expenses to allow a relative to accompany you in order to care for your dependants whilst you attend a meeting or event     extended hours with a care worker/childminder/play scheme to allow you to return home later than normal.  You are eligible to apply if:     you are a chemist     you will incur additional caring expenses while attending a chemistry-related meeting, conference, workshop or professional development event     you will use these funds to cover the cost of care that you usually provide     you are based in the UK or Ireland or if not, you will normally have held three years RSC membership (either past or current). We have designed the process to be straightforward and will ask you to provide brief details of the event and a description of how the grant will be used. We aim to respond to you within six weeks of your application.  To apply please complete the Grants for Carers application form. Multiple applications, up to the maximum value of £1,000 per year, will be considered. All applications will be individually assessed at our discretion. Please note that, if you receive a grant, you will need to complete a Grants for Carers return form and submit receipts after your attendance at the event.   Addressing inequality These grants have been introduced following the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Breaking the barriers report which found that 78% of chemists working in UK academia felt that managing parenting and/or caring responsibilities had an impact on women’s retention and progression. However, applications to this fund are not limited to female scientists – anyone with caring responsibilities is welcome to apply.

There will be a combination of resource overview talks and application talks which illustrate the use of specific online resources with real world examples.  2.Undergraduate Networking Session This free networking opportunity gives undergraduates an opportunity to discuss their research, posters, and career goals with other attendees in an intimate setting. All attendees are encouraged to come to this event to welcome the undergraduate students, many of whom may be attending a large conference for the first time. Light refreshments will be provided. *No posters will be at this session. Undergraduates who submitted poster abstracts should put their posters in the main poster hall upon arriving at the conference.          3.PUI Faculty Development Workshop This workshop is for faculty currently working at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) or early career scientists who would like to get a job at a PUI. PUIs are defined as institutions that offer few or no PhDs in the sciences. While teaching is a large part of being a PUI faculty member, maintaining a successful research program is also critical for career advancement and for providing undergraduates with high-caliber research experiences. Given the high demand on faculty time at PUIs, research collaborations are an integral part of maintaining a productive research program. This workshop will include presentations and discussions on different types of collaborative projects and tools PUI faculty can used to build successful collaborations. This will include presentations by a panel of faculty on different types of collaborative projects as well as opportunities for small-group tool building among participants.  4.Discovering the rules of life through computational plant biology – utilizing dynamical mathematical models at the molecular, organismal, and ecosystem levels At the workshop, participants will be put into groups and provided with ‘toy problems’ to solve. They will be tasked with reformulating of these problems to be more appropriate for discussion of mathematical frameworks, including differential equations, Markov Chains, and cellular automata. Participant groups will decide which of the presented methods would be best suited for their toy problems. The ‘solutions’ will be presented by our panel of experts, who will discuss their rationales with the participants. At the end of the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to receive real-time consultation on their computational questions. Participants can display an A4-sized poster with a diagram of their system with a brief paragraph giving background information and research questions. The panel of experts will then give comments where appropriate on suggested next steps.  5.Change the World with SciComm! Public policies can have far-reaching impacts on scientific research, and vice-versa. Policymakers, regulators, and the public need information about issues that relate to plant biology. Through invited speakers and hands-on activities, this workshop will help participants impact policy with the following strategies: 1. Communicate about science directly to lawmakers and other policymakers. 2. Contribute public comments on new or updated regulations that impact your research. 3. Communicate the impacts of science policies with the public through storytelling. Our goal is to inspire participants to reach out and change the world through science communication!  6.Perspectives in Science Leadership and Policy with Dr. Sharlene Weatherwax Are you a science leader? Should science policy matter to you? How can scientists at all levels of experience and interest in plant science contribute towards leadership and science policy? A successful and vibrant research enterprise depends on diversity, equity, inclusion, and perspectives from different contexts. Dr. Sharlene Weatherwax will present observations and lessons learned from a nonlinear path to a nontraditional career in science management and policy, highlighting some expected and unanticipated potholes and roadblocks. You will receive some practical tips to nurture and develop your inner leader, identify your policy interests and empower future actions.           7.Get Your Message Across: A Guide to Artwork and Illustrations for Better Impact and Clarity This workshop will cover the production of artwork and illustrations that effectively convey information and complex concepts. The workshop will consist of short presentations on principles of good design, using R/Python to generate complex data figures and software and other resources that can be used to produce effective figures. Pointers on fonts, colors, density of data, and design of graphs for publication will also be presented. The presentations will be followed by a question & answer period.  8.Plant Science Decadal Vision (2020-2030) Making the vision a reality Our planet and species are facing an interrelated set of profound challenges with limited time and diminishing opportunity to solve. To address these challenges, ASPB and the plant science community have come together to develop an innovative Plant Science Decadal Vision (DV). The goals of the Decadal Vision span People, Research, and Technology – but addressing these goals will require unprecedented collaborations within and outside the plant and microbial sciences, new technologies, new training paradigms, new work cultures, and the broadening of participation.Organized by the Plant Science Research Network (PSRN), this workshop will highlight opportunities to get involved in the effort to advance our community towards these ambitious and challenging goals. The organizers will provide an overview of the report and facilitate an interactive discussion on how ASPB members can work to promote the vision. Contact: Natalie          9.Allies 101: How to support and affirm the LGBTQ+ community in lab and the classroom LGBTQ+ students have reduced retention rates in STEM compared to their heterosexual peers. 30% of STEM professionals are not ‘out’ to their colleagues. Welcoming workplaces increase the likely of professionals to be out to their collogues, while student LGBTQ+ supportive organizations decrease the odds of students encountering homophobic comments. In our workshop we will talk about ways to improve the lab and classroom environment for LGBTQ+ students and professionals for Allies. We will focus on easily changeable aspects of the classroom and lab culture to improve accessibility and support for LGBTQ+ folks. Other topics we will discuss include LGBTQ+ Vocabulary 101, how to find local LGBTQ+ resources and ways to bring them up for folks in need, and also discuss how to be a good ally for folks who are transitioning and coming out. This will be an interactive workshop, aimed to educated professionals and to also help them identify resources in their local communities.  What are pronouns and how do you know when to use which ones? Someone just came out to me, what do I do? Does my school/company have resources for LGBTQ+ folks? Mental health resources for LGBT+ folks in my community?          10.How FDA can help you bring new plant varieties to market This session will explain how you can use FDA’s voluntary food safety consultation processes as part of new variety development. Discussion will include the types of data and information that are typically considered as part of a consultation. Emphasis will be placed on how these processes may be used by small and medium-sized entities (including universities). This session will also discuss FDA’s view of foods from genome edited plant varieties.          11.Implicit Bias & Conscious Inclusion Workshop (breakfast) organized by the Minority Affairs and the Women in Plant Biology Committees We are all guilty of being implicitly bias, and acknowledging this is not always easy, especially when we are not equipped to address this and do not always know what to do. Join us for an in-depth understanding of what unconscious bias is, how it effects our decisions and the harm that can result from it. In this interactive workshop, we will learn to identify the ways that bias shows up in our own lives, different strategies to limit its effects in our decision making, and finally how to be more conscious about inclusion.           12.Equity, Diversity, Inclusion: Effecting Institutional Change (Lunch with Guest Speaker) Organized by the Minority Affairs Committee – more details coming soon          13.Inclusive Pedagogy As educators, we want all of our students to feel valued and supported. This workshop features several speakers who will present their perspectives on intentionally inclusive pedagogy. From sample assignments to attitudes to course policies, participants will learn about the many ways that they can make their classrooms and curricula more inclusive. Workshop participants will then work in small groups with the speakers to brainstorm and develop their own sets of materials, tips, and tricks that can be brought back into the classroom. The workshop is open to current and future educators at all student levels.          Communicating for Impact: Workshop on engaging meaningfully with your neighbors, your elected officials, funders and the broader public about plant science This workshop, led by James Carrington, President of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, provides guidance and real-world examples of how to meaningfully engage with the public—ranging from your local community to policy makers. Communicating the promise of plant science is the foundation from which public demand and funding (both government and philanthropic) for plant science will grow. Workshop participants will hear from experienced communicators about their successes and failures and how to:  • Communicate with the Public with Purpose • Communicate with Elected Officials and Policy Makers • Communicate with Government Agencies and Philanthropies          14.Careers beyond academia: DC edition Graduate training of plant biologists occurs primarily in universities, and students have little exposure to plant biology careers apart from the academic path. This workshop will provide discussion of a diversity of career options available to those with graduate degrees in plant biology. Panelists will be selected to represent a variety of careers including in those in large and small private companies, government, etc. The workshop format will include introduction of career options by the panelists followed by small group discussions.          15.Bridging the gap between lab and field: designing and using fabricated ecosystems to explore plant-soil-microbial interactions.  16.Market driven innovation in plant science  17.USDA, DOE & NSF Grant Information Session)	Yes (1.

None	Yes! 1.Mentoring the Mentor:  A Mentor-Training Workshop(Description: There is ample evidence that mentoring plays an important role in achieving a satisfying and successful career in academia.  While most in academia find themselves in the role of mentor at some point in their career, few have had formal training in best practices for mentoring, particularly in the context of mentoring women and underrepresented minorities.)    2. Non-academic Careers in Physical Anthropology (Description: There are many career paths within Physical Anthropology that lie outside, or partially outside, of academia. However, these careers are frequently under-represented at annual meetings due to the academic nature of these conferences. Still, greater representation of non-academic careers within physical anthropology helps to diversify the field and helps to build these professions by attracting talented early career professionals that frequent annual meetings.)  3.Creating An Ad Hoc Early Career Committee (Bioanthropologists who have recently completed their PhDs struggle to find continuing mentorship, understand and navigate the job market and tenure process, develop independent research programs, and learn to mentor students. As our fastest growing group of members students transitioning into early career status, the importance of addressing the needs of this group will only grow. This session will address the utility and structure of an ad hoc Early Career Committee (ECC) to represent the needs of this growing group. The discussion will be led by a mix of previous Early Career and Student Liaisons, all of whom are pre-tenure anthropologists within 10 years of their PhD.)    4. Navigating the Intercultural Landscape of Gender-Based Harassment and Assault in Fieldwork (Clancy and colleagues (2014) demonstrated that scientific fieldwork often exposes researchers to gender-based harassment and sexual assault with women trainees more frequently targeted.  Our subsequent disciplinary conversation about mitigating harassment and assault in fieldwork has focused largely on supervisor-trainee relationships grounded in shared professional training and cultural expectations.  This has left a gap in addressing gender-based harassment and sexual harassment issues between researchers and local collaborators or employees. These can be challenging and complex due to cultural differences in expectations for interpersonal relationships and in local laws and norms around harassment and assault.  Women and LGBT researchers conducting independent research or establishing research sites in socially conservative places can find themselves vulnerable to gender-based harassment and assault from local collaborators and employees or may find themselves responsible for local employees who are accused of, or victims of, harassment or assault. Additionally, researchers in the field lack protections and guidance we expect from home institutions and law enforcement.  This panel discussion and roundtable will bring together researchers at different career levels who have worked independently in the field to discuss their experience establishing and managing collaborative relationships with local researchers, employees, and communities.  Panelists will discuss their strategies in preventing, managing, or handling gender-based harassment and assault within complex intercultural contexts. Policies emphasizing safety and inclusion, and establishing protocols and mechanisms for reporting and responding to harassment and assault within a field site, can improve the safety of trainees and early-career researchers (Clancy et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2017). The goal of this panel is both to provide an opportunity and safe space to discuss personal experiences to begin the process of developing guidelines and best practices for field researchers as they work to establish field sites where researchers and local partners are not vulnerable to harassment or assault.)  5.Choosing, Evaluating, and Using Online Resources in Your Classes (Description: Online resources for teaching anthropology are accessible, helpful, and mostly free. But these resources also vary in value, and it can be a challenge to incorporate them into your curriculum. Participants are asked to bring their laptops and information about sources that have worked (or not) in their classrooms. We will also discuss teaching students how to evaluate online resources.) 6. Citing Marginalized Scholars in Biological Anthropology(Description: Who we cite has consequences. Citational practices, including whose ideas we teach and work with, influence what becomes the core sensibilities that shape knowledge production in our field. Importantly, the subset of work that we conventionally cite does not match the diversity of ideas that exist in biological anthropology.  Not all scholars are cited equally, and this is shaped by race, class, sex, and gender inequalities. The work of scholars like Earnest Hooton and Carleton Coon have frequently been amplified, while the work of scholars like W. Montague Cobb has often historically been obscured. This form of silencing perpetuates the marginalization of historically underrepresented scholars in biological anthropology, making it difficult for an increasingly diverse generation of researchers to identify with this field. Shifting citational practices is therefore a crucial site of intervention.)  7.Career Development Panel: How to Write a Grant Proposal (Description: Panelists Rebecca Ferrell (Program Director, Biological Anthropology, National Science Foundation), Paddy Moore (Grant and Program Officer, Leakey Foundation), Danilyn Rutherford (President, Wenner-Gren Foundation) and Miguel Vilar (Senior Program Officer, National Geographic Society) will describe funding programs available to early career researchers. In addition to offering practical advice on how to write a competitive grant proposal for their programs, the panelists will be available to answer questions from the audience)  8.Understanding the NSF Broader Impacts Criterion and Developing the Societal Impact of Your Science(Description: The NSF Broader Impacts merit review criterion requires applicants to propose/present ways in which their research will benefit society, beyond the advancement of knowledge and theory in particular research areas. These broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through activities directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but complementary to, a project.  Student and faculty applicants to NSF programs, including Biological Anthropology, routinely have questions about what activities “count” as broader impacts, what NSF panels and program officers currently expect in terms of broader impacts plans for various types of proposals, and how to develop and present effective plans. These applicants may or may not be thinking more broadly about identifying/integrating societal impacts into their research design, outside of the requirements of a particular funding agency.  The two-hour session will include: specific information about NSF Broader Impacts in the context of the NSF merit review system (20-30 minute presentation: Ferrell), shared experiences of 4-6 NSF student and faculty grantees (and 1+ non-grantees) with a variety of broader impacts activities (panelists will represent a number of sub-fields, and cover a variety of activities, potentially including science communication, museum outreach, K-12 activities and science education, community outreach/involvement and citizen science, undergraduate and graduate training, public health impacts, conservation impacts, etc.), and time for questions from the audience, and, potentially (depending on room set-up) break-out groups for attendees to discuss further with individual panelists and NSF staff.  Opportunity for attendees to provide feedback and input on questions, challenges, and needs related to implementation of broader impacts in their research.)  9. Mentoring for teaching-focused careers(Description: Increasing numbers of anthropologists are embracing jobs at teaching-focused colleges and universities both inside and outside of anthropology departments. As, by definition, PhD programs exist at research-focused universities, graduate students may have a difficult time finding mentors to help them prepare application materials geared towards teaching-focused institutions.  In this workshop, registrants will be paired with AAPA members currently employed at community colleges, liberal arts colleges, and teaching-focused universities. Before the meeting, registrants will supply drafts of their cover letter and teaching philosophy to their mentor. During this workshop, mentors and mentees will meet in person to review these application materials and discuss the teaching-focused job market. The goal of this workshop is to assist job-seeking AAPA members in strengthening their applications for teaching-focused jobs, and to provide support and networking opportunities for members interested in pursuing teaching-focused careers. This workshop is organized by the Anthropologists outside of Anthropology Departments, Contingent and Teaching Focused faculty subgroup of the Committee on Diversity.)	Yes (Cobb Professional Development Grants: The American Association of Physical Anthropologists recognizes that the professional development of talented scientists in the early stages of their careers is critical to the continued health and vitality of the discipline. Applicants must be junior faculty members (such as postdoctoral scholars, lecturers, or Assistant Professors) and must be non-tenured at the time of application and award. Individuals in non-traditional positions equivalent to these junior faculty positions are also encouraged to apply. Membership in the AAPA is NOT a requirement. An applicant may receive only one Professional Development Grant during their career.The budget should not exceed $7,500)   Also Student Presentation Awards: The American Association of Physical Anthropologists awards prizes to outstanding presentations at the annual meeting whose first author is a student member. The AAPA has long recognized the important contributions made to our discipline by students. For decades, specific named awards were conferred for outstanding podium and poster presentations. A list of these awards and awardees can be found below. As our annual meeting has grown and the distinctions between podium and poster presentations are blurred, the AAPA Executive Committee has elected to bestow each AAPA-supported award (usually between 4-6) as an American Association of Physical Anthropologists Award for Outstanding Student Presentation. Similarly, the AAPA will also confer the American Association of Physical Anthropologists Honorable Mention for Student Presentation. Endowed awards, awards supported by journals and publishers, along with awards co-sponsored with other organizations will remain unchanged in name.  Awards For an excellent poster or podium presentation on bones or teeth The Mildred Trotter Prize  For an excellent poster or podium presentation on primatology The Patricia Whitten Prize  For an excellent poster or podium presentation on human or primate evolution The Journal of Human Evolution Prize  For excellent poster and podium presentations that are judged to best implement either traditional or state-of-the-art anatomical methodologies in innovative anthropological research (subject to co-funding by the Association of Anatomists).  The AAA-AAPA Anatomy in Anthropology poster and podium prizes  There are many more excellent student poster and podium presentations than we have named awards. As the result a number of Honorable Mention Prizes are awarded each year. The Honorable Mention Prizes  Eligibility: To be eligible for a prize, a paper or poster must meet the following criteria: The first author must be a student member (or special member who is a student) of the AAPA at the time of abstract submission who has not previously won a prize for an AAPA presentation. Individuals who have completed all terminal degree requirements before the abstract submission deadline are ineligible for a student prize. However, the first author may be a Regular Member at the time of presentation. The first author must be a member of the AAPA at the time the meeting is held (Student or Special). The paper and the project to be presented must be primarily the work of the first author The abstract must have been accepted for either a podium or poster presentation of the main AAPA meeting (exclusive of the COD Undergraduate Research Symposium). The first author student must personally make the presentation of the paper or poster.  The value of the each award is $500.   	Yes William S. Pollitzer Student Travel Award (Qualifications: This award is open to all AAPA student members (undergraduate and graduate) who are attending the annual meeting. You DO NOT have to be giving a paper to compete or receive an award. You DO need to be a MEMBER of the AAPA at the time of the meeting, and you need to have not been granted your PhD before the submission deadline. Students from underrepresented groups in biological anthropology, those who are the first in their family to go to college, or are undergraduate students at two-year and four-year colleges (without graduate programs) are strongly encouraged to apply. Award: Up to $500 to defray travel costs to the meetings. Application and Essay: The essay question changes each year. Awards are made on the basis of an essay of no more than 750 words long (excluding references). Any submission over 750 words will be automatically disqualified. References are not counted towards the 750 words and should be included in the same text box with the essay. In 2019, the AAPA formally adopted a new position statement on race and racism (https://physanth.org/about/position-statements/aapa-statement-race-and-racism-2019/). The Association is uniquely positioned to offer such a statement, given the historical roles that biological anthropologists have played in the creation and perpetuation of racialized systems of oppression and discrimination. In our professional contexts, biological anthropologists have opportunities to address "race," educate students, and inform publics about the science of human biological variation.

Childcare times: 8:30am - 5:50pm for the duration of the conference Registration fee: €100 per child, per conference What's provided?: All necessary equipment such as meals, beds, toys and diapers are provided. Criteria  The following criteria must be met to be eligible for EMBL childcare: The child must be between 3 months and 3 years One or both parents must be registered participants to the corresponding conference If your child has special dietary needs, requires medicine or special nappies, this must be provided for the duration of the conference You must agree to the EMBL Kinderhaus Medical Guidelines Valid travel insurance is required (in addition to the EMBL visitors insurance that covers the child during the conference)  As childcare spaces are limited, registration will be on a first-come first-served basis. Your place can only be confirmed after payment of the registration fee. The children of conference participants who are registered for childcare at EMBL are covered by the EMBL liability insurance in the case that something should happen to them whilst under the care of the kindergarten teacher (e.g. if they fall or injure themselves). It is nevertheless required that the conference participants also arrange health or travel insurance for themselves and their child which is valid in Germany, and that covers them in the case of illness or accident in which they are at fault that takes place when the child is not in the EMBL childcare, or an accident that takes place off the EMBL premises.  We accept international bank transfers up to 8 weeks before the conference starts, after which we will only accept credit card payments made via our online payment system. NO visa support letters will be issued for the child until payment of the registration fee is confirmed.  Cancellation of any booked onsite childcare service should be submitted in writing or via email and is valid only with acknowledgement of receipt by the EMBL Course & Conference Office. Cancellation fees are dependent on the notice given. If cancellation occurs less than 7 days prior to the start of the booked childcare service, the cancellation fee is 100% of the fee. If cancellation occurs between 7 days and 1 month prior to the start of the event, the cancellation fee is 50% of the fee. Earlier than 1 month, a cancellation fee of EUR 50 will be charged or 50% of the fee, whichever is the lower. If the onsite childcare service has been booked by the registration deadline of the event and a visa is not awarded in time to travel to the event, the full fee for the onsite childcare will be reimbursed. In this case, the visa rejection letter or proof that the visa application process has been initiated on time is required before reimbursement is processed.

The Early Professionals Mini-Talk Symposium is designed to highlight the exciting research and professional activities performed by ornithologists in the early stages of their careers (i.e. have defended their PhD in the past 7 years, pursuing/initiating a research career, in the first five years of an agency/private sector position, etc). During this lively and fast-paced event, participants will have 4 minutes and 30 seconds to showcase their recent professional advances, the techniques they employ, the future directions their career will take, and their broader identity as ornithologists. At the conclusion of the talks, the participants will sit as a panel to take questions from the audience on their visions of where ornithology is headed, and how they see themselves contributing. The organizers will prepare some questions ahead of time, but will also take questions from the audience. This event will be live tweeted, therefore participants will be asked to submit a tweet (280 characters) summarizing their research program prior to the symposium. Please note that participation in this symposium does NOT preclude you from also submitting an abstract for the normal program; you may participate in both. Following the talks there will be an Early Professional Social, a chance to meet with the participants and other early career and senior ornithologists. To give all attendees the opportunity to learn about these early career researchers, the symposium is a stand-alone event. Please stay tuned for the exact times and locations.  Goal of the Symposium The goal is to introduce yourself to the audience, which will contain ornithologists both inside and outside of your field, and get them excited about your career trajectory. You are encouraged to be broad and present the big picture. This forum is meant for you to showcase you as a scientist and what your contributions are to the field (both present and future), and NOT the specific details of your most recent paper. Your abstract should be a professional summary and provide the overarching question guiding your research, main research themes, and the tools you use to address your research questions or other professional goals, examples of projects you have worked on, and a discussion of your future directions. There are many ways to approach this abstract and presentation—make it your own. The goal is to communicate who you are as a scientist.ow you achieve that goal is up to you.)

This year at ESA we are hosting our first ever Queer mixer: Queer people in science face particular challenges, whether that be working in locations that are unsafe and intolerant of LGBT+ individuals, or being in a work environment that is dominated by cis- and heteronormativity. There is increasing awareness of the underrepresentation of minorities in the sciences. Recognising this inequality is the first step to meeting the challenge of enhancing diversity and inclusivity in science. A 2013 survey (Yoder and Mattheis 2016) of people in STEM fields found that 40% of LGBTQ+ identified respondents are not out to their colleagues. This is not the culture we strive for in ecology, and not within ESA. Enhancing the visibility of LGBTQ+ people (umbrella term for non-heterosexual or cisgender individuals: Queer) in ecology is important to enhancing the inclusive and diverse culture of the scientific field in Australia. ESA is in the position to influence the broader community of ecologists and ecology-related fields in Australia. Modelling off of the success of the British Ecological Society (BES) LGBT+ network and mixers (https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/membership-community/diversity/) , we will host a Queer mixer at ESA19 in Launceston.          2. Equity or Diversity Concerns? – You’ve got an Ally! We are striving to improve Equity and Diversity within ESA (and elsewhere) via our Equity and Diversity Policy and the addition of the Conference Code of Conduct. On a more personal level though, we want to provide a safe space for our members and conference attendees to raise issues outside of formal pathways, because often, the best time to say something is now! ESA has nominated a team of Equity and Diversity Allies at the 2019 conference to provide support for members who may have an equity and/or diversity issue, and to provide an avenue to lodge feedback or a complaint. If you would like to talk to someone please seek out one of the people listed below (look for the rainbow lanyard!). If you can’t find them, just ask at the ESA booth and we will help link you up. We can guarantee that any conversations will be handled with understanding and confidentiality.Interested in joining or contributing to the Equity & Diversity Working Group? Contact Gail at the ESA Booth.)	Yes (The ESA encourages student attendance at its annual conference by providing a number of student travel grants each year. Every student who applies for the grant and meets the criteria (until the allocation is exhausted) will receive some level of funding depending on the geographic location of their home campus (funding amounts shown below). The grants will be awarded in the order they were received once abstract confirmations have been sent out, you are welcome to apply beforehand, but will not be awarded a grant if your abstract is not accepted. ​ The amount of the grant received will be based on relative travel costs of all applicants, and are generally determined on the basis of relative costs of air travel. In addition to the usual travel grants, up to five extra travel grants (Wiley Student Fellowships) will be sponsored by Wiley Publishing. These fellowships will be awarded to individuals from the pool of applicants who have the highest travel costs. To be eligible for a student travel grant, applicants must be a member of the Society, be the presenting author of a talk or poster, and not have previously won a travel grant from the Society.)	https://www.esa2019.org.au/code-of-conduct-for-the-esa-annual-conference-and-events/	None	None	5 Women: 2Men	Not Applicable to this conference.

None	Yes(Pre-Conference Workshops  Early Careers Day This one-day workshop will begin with an inspiring plenary on ‘unlocking your potential’ from Professor Jane Memmot. Following this you will take part in a number of sessions including an introduction to the policy-science interface, making the most of funding opportunities and building resilience when publishing your research. You’ll have the opportunity to meet fellow early career ecologists and you’ll leave the workshop feeling ready to make the most of networking opportunities during the Annual Meeting.  Graphic Recording: Communicating Research in an Engaging Way How can we communicate our research in a visual format? In this workshop, participants will learn layout and design tools while developing their visual vocabularies, with the aim of creating a visual abstract or schematic. Participants should bring an idea or topic that they would like to work on.  Building data collection apps with Coreo If your organisation is considering the use of apps to improve field-based data collection this workshop will show you how you can build your own using Coreo. We will also explore the data management and visualisation features of the Coreo platform.  Using data provenance to create reproducible, transparent, and well-documented code for statistical analysis and modelling in R Reproducibility engenders trust in and rapidly advances science, but it is hard to reproduce ecological analyses. Participants will work with software tools that use data provenance to help construct and debug R scripts, transparently document analytical workflows, and simplify re-use of the data and associated R code.  A gentle introduction to the COMADRE & COMPADRE databases for demographic analyses We will introduce the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, which contain thousands of matrix population models for species across the tree of life, as well as two R packages that allow for comparative analyses and interpretation of demographic data: Rcompadre and Rage.  Tools of the Interdisciplinary Trade: how to make your interdisciplinary project a success Human-nature relationships lie at the heart of many ecological challenges. As a result, ecologists often find themselves working at the intersection between natural and social sciences – with little preparatory training. This workshop will identify common pitfalls and good practices for interdisciplinary research in ecology, from developing a funding proposal to project implementation and publication.  How to run the best fieldcourse to develop key graduate skills The aim of this interactive, peer-peer workshop is to provide an informal but guided forum for experienced field educators to consider ways to enhance their teaching practice. We will focus on the attributes that employers require in ecology graduates and share best field-based teaching practice for developing key graduate skills.  Indigenous Knowledge: what is it, where do I find it, how can I use it? Incorporating Indigenous Knowledge in ecological research is an ethical commitment and a practical consideration in negotiating access. More than this, it is an essential component of robust and effective ecology, informing successful research design. This workshop uses practical examples to demonstrate anthropological methods useful in engaging with indigenous knowledge  Getting social for science communication Terrified by Twitter? Flummoxed by Facebook? Or seeking an extra push for your science via social? We’ll introduce different social media platforms and tips and tricks for getting the most from them. Participants will have the chance to build and enhance their social media profile, learn about communicating their science, and create some games. You’ll leave equipped with tools to communicate your science effectively on social media!  OURsoils:  developing citizen science and public engagement The BES, Imperial College and OPAL are developing a nationwide programme of citizen science and public engagement.  OURsoils seeks to Observe, Understand and Research, Respect and Re-imagine Soils.  This workshop is an interactive chance to get involved, develop ideas, learn from each other and share experiences in taking this project forward.  How to be a good Associate Editor BES Publications Team  This workshop will provide training for Associate Editors handling manuscript for any ecology journal. It will cover: How to assess a manuscript on initial submission, finding reviewers, how to assess reviewer comments, handling revisions, and writing good recommendation letters to authors.  Publication ethics for researchers This panel and Q&A will discuss publication ethics issues in research (including authorship and plagiarism). It look at how to avoid issues before they happen, but will also show the systems in place for dealing with problem and show that even post-publication problems can be fixable.  Work–Life Balance in Real Life In this panel discussion, invited speakers share how they have juggled different challenging life situations throughout their academic careers and discuss the approaches they take that help them balance their work and personal lives.  Enabling Work–Life Balance in Your Research Group There is a lot group leaders can do to allow all team members to reach a healthier work–life balance. This workshop explores the importance of role modelling and equips attendees with simple strategies that they can take back to their own institutions and start implementing right away.  Careers Outside of Academia: Join us for this increasingly popular discussion, in which members of the panel will share their experiences of forming a career outside of academia. Representing a breadth of ecological careers, each panel member will give an overview of their respective role and provide advice on the transition from academia.

Participants of ECMTB 2018 can sign up to be part of the mentorship program, either as a mentee, a mentor, or both. Junior scientists can request to be mentored by a senior scientist, and senior scientists can offer themselves as mentors. Junior scientists include students, post-doctoral fellows, research assistants and newly appointed faculty members. Senior scientists include postdoctoral fellows, research assistants, established faculty members. The following types of interactions between mentors and mentees are encouraged:      -mentors and mentees have a lunch (or dinner) together to discuss the mentees’ scientific interests and educational plan and/or career aims;      -mentors share their career experience with their mentees;     - mentors attend the (poster or lecture) presentation of the mentee and provide constructive feedback;      -mentors introduce mentees to their colleagues to help the mentee establish a professional network.  Typically, the mentor initiates these activities. However, we encourage mentees to also prepare for their participation, with specific questions and goals they would like to achieve at the conference.

A handful of students who apply for a travel award will receive an Ungerleider/Zimbardo Travel Scholarship from the American Psychological Foundation. Applicants must have psychology as the primary focus of their graduate studies (even if they are receiving training in other fields as well). They should be enrolled full time and in good standing in their graduate programs.  Applicants may be citizens or residents of any country and their institutions may be located and accredited/recognized in any country.  Applicants must be student affiliates or associate members of APA (graduate student affiliates are automatically members of APAGS — see student affiliate application for details). Students who are not affiliates must apply for affiliation when submitting materials for the travel award; however, all materials must be received by the Science Directorate in a single, complete package.  Research papers or posters must already have been accepted by an APA division for presentation.  Students must be first author on the accepted research paper or poster. Multiple author submissions are acceptable, but the student applicant must be the designated presenter of the research. If there are multiple student authors, only the first author may apply for these funds. If the student applicant has been accepted to present more than one paper or poster, she or he must choose only one paper/poster presentation to use when applying for this award.  Students who are designated presenters in a division-sponsored symposium are also eligible to apply for this award. Each psychology department (i.e., not individual programs within a department) may endorse no more than three students per year for the travel award. If more than three students from a department wish to apply for these funds, the department must perform an initial screening and forward only three applications. In addition to being eligible to apply for a travel award, students who are both members of APAGS and first authors are also eligible to have their convention registration fees waived. Further information about this potential fee waiver will be emailed to eligible students by early June.)	None	None	None	1 Man	Featured Speakers: 1 Man: 1 Woman	Data not available online.
