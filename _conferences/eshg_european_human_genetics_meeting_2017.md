code_of_conduct: 'None'
safety_instructions: 'No App but instruction were provided on conference website(Safety – Crime Copenhagen remains a relatively safe, secure city. However, use of common sense is (always) required, as in any large city. Experience has shown that some basic precautionary measures should always be kept in mind in any city: – Do not carry important items like flight tickets, passports etc. with you when visiting the conference or strolling through the city, leave them in the hotel safe during your stay. Rather carry a Xerox copy of your passport or an identity card with you. – Try not to carry all documents, money, credit cards and other essential items and valuables in one bag or purse. If it is lost or stolen, everything will be gone and might be difficult to replace on short notice, especially passports and visa to return to your country of residence. – Take off your name badge when leaving the conference centre. – In heavily frequented tourist zones and the metro at rush hour, be aware of attemps of scam and pickpocketing. – Do not respond to anybody unknown to you who comes up to you on the street engaging you in a conversation, no matter how safe they appear to be. A list of current scam schemes and further advice can be found: Further advice can be found on Copenhagen Trip Advisory website) '
