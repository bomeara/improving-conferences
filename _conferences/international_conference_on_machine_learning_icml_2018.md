ICML is working to expand these efforts to make the conference as welcoming as possible to all. In addition to hosting diversity-related events, the conference is also making and considering structural changes. These include a new Code of Conduct introduced in 2018. We are actively working to make the conference event itself more inclusive, including supporting childcare, nursing mothers, attendees with disabilities, and gender inclusive measures.  We are also exploring options with the venue and caterers to ensure that everyone can have a positive, equitable conference experience.)'
