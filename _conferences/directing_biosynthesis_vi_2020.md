This fund is not limited to women scientists and welcomes applications from anyone with caring responsibilities. These grants have been supported by The Royal Society of Chemistry’s Chemists’ Community Fund. Caring responsibilities are wide and varied, and so each application will be individually assessed, examples of applications that we will consider include: paying for extra home help or nursing care for a dependent whilst you will not be present additional medical/respite care for a dependent whilst you will not be present travel expenses for a relative to travel with you to care for dependents whilst you attend a meeting or event paying for extended hours with a care worker/childminder/play scheme to cover time when you will arrive home later than normal.)'
