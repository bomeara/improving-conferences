However, SMBE recognizes that travel funds may not be available at this critical time. Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students may apply for travel awards to attend the annual SMBE meeting. Awardees are granted up to US $1500 for travel within the same continent, and up to US $2000 for long-haul travel. Reimbursements are processed after the meeting and awardees may claim travel, accommodation and meeting registration expenses.)'
