The childcare booking form was available until 6 July 2018. Childcare will be provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

The nannies will give the child only food and snacks provided by the parent/guardian. A water dispenser will be available in the childcare area. If parents/guardians want to bring any other drink, they can provide the drink and the nannies will give it to the child.  Health Insurance Parents/guardians are required to have their own medical insurance which fully covers their child, including any medical or hospitalization expenses, repatriation in case of medical emergency, accident causing permanent disability or death.  Liability Insurance The parents/guardians will be responsible for any damage caused by their children at all times. The parents/guardians’ liability insurance shall include the coverage for all damages to personal belongings by their child’s own carelessness or negligence (for example, a child stumbles and shatters his or another child’s spectacles, or a child damages her own or another child’s clothes), loss of personal belongings and theft of belongings.  Liability Except gross negligence or willful misconduct, the International AIDS Society and Tante Marloes, the selected childcare provider, shall not be liable for any damage caused. The parent/guardian agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the International AIDS Society and Tante Marloes harmless from and against any and all liability, loss and expense (including attorney’s fees) or any claims arising out of or resulting from its activity and caused by their child. How to book Childcare Services for your Accompanying Child(ren)  Parents/guardians must have submitted the childcare booking form before the 6 July 2018. Childcare booking is not complete until receipt of a written confirmation email stating that the booking has been accepted. Confirmations are sent by email within 4 days of receipt of booking. Parents/guardians will receive a final email from the childcare provider beginning of July 2018, asking to reconfirm their child’s attendance at the childcare services. Parents/guardians must reply to this email within four days. No reply in due time will lead to the childcare booking being cancelled.  Please note In order to have access to the childcare service, the child must be registered as an “accompanying child” for the conference at the applicable registration fee and in accordance with the Terms and Conditions for delegates. In addition, the parent/guardian consent form must be completed for each accompanying child and submitted to the AIDS 2018 Registration Department. Children without an “accompanying children” registration and name badge will not be given access to the conference area, and will therefore not have access to the childcare room.  Additional information It is the parent/guardian’s responsibility to provide all important information related to the child (including allergies and health conditions) when submitting the childcare booking form, and to remind the caregiver on site when checking the child in at the childcare room. For children with special needs, the childcare service provider reserves the right to not accept the application, based on the capacity of the childcare services, on a case-by-case basis. The childcare services will not administer any prescription medicine to the children. Parents/guardians must return to the childcare facility to dispense any medicine to their child. For the health of other children in care, sick children will not be allowed into the childcare facility.
