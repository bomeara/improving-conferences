ecr_promotion_events: 'Yes (1. Student Presentation Awards. 2. Social reception following the Early Professionals Mini-Talk Symposium, which will provide a chance to meet with the participants and other early career and mid/senior ornithologists:We invite you to submit an abstract for consideration as a presentation during the 7th Annual Early Professionals Mini-Talk Symposium that will be part of the North American Ornithological Conference (NAOC) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from 10–15 August. The Early Professionals Mini-Talk Symposium is designed to highlight the exciting research and professional activities performed by ornithologists in the early stages of their careers (i.e. have defended their PhD in the past 7 years, pursuing/initiating a research career, in the first five years of an agency/private sector position, etc). During this lively and fast-paced event, participants will have 4 minutes and 30 seconds to showcase their recent professional advances, the techniques they employ, the future directions their career will take, and their broader identity as ornithologists. At the conclusion of the talks, the participants will sit as a panel to take questions from the audience on their visions of where ornithology is headed, and how they see themselves contributing. The organizers will prepare some questions ahead of time, but will also take questions from the audience. This event will be live tweeted, therefore participants will be asked to submit a tweet (280 characters) summarizing their research program prior to the symposium. Please note that participation in this symposium does NOT preclude you from also submitting an abstract for the normal program; you may participate in both. Following the talks there will be an Early Professional Social, a chance to meet with the participants and other early career and senior ornithologists. To give all attendees the opportunity to learn about these early career researchers, the symposium is a stand-alone event. Goal of the Symposium: The goal is to introduce yourself to the audience, which will contain ornithologists both inside and outside of your field, and get them excited about your career trajectory. You are encouraged to be broad and present the big picture. This forum is meant for you to showcase you as a scientist and what your contributions are to the field (both present and future), and NOT the specific details of your most recent paper. Your abstract should be a professional summary and provide the overarching question guiding your research, main research themes, and the tools you use to address your research questions or other professional goals, examples of projects you have worked on, and a discussion of your future directions. There are many ways to approach this abstract and presentation—make it your own. The goal is to communicate who you are as a scientist. How you achieve that goal is up to you.)'
