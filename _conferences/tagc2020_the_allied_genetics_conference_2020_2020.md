Children are allowed in keynote, concurrent, and poster sessions; this includes babywearing of young children. To ensure the safety of all children in attendance and to create a productive and fulfilling meeting atmosphere for all attendees, we ask all parents and caregivers to abide by the following guidelines: Children age 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult in all meeting areas.

Large sessions will have seating at the back of the room reserved for attendees with children to allow for easy access into and out of the room. These seats will be clearly marked. For safety reasons, children are not allowed in the exhibit/poster hall during set-up or break-down times. Resources: Milk Stork, BabyQuip '
