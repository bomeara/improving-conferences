gender_balance: 'No Apps but a note on safety on conference websit says: Safety Cape Town is a very cool place, with beautiful scenery and friendly people, but please take good care of your safety. The tourist areas such as the V&A Waterfront, and the area around the convention center are relatively safe, but staying vigilant is never a bad idea. Please do not go out at night on your own, and, even with friends, avoid walking back to your hotel at night (take a taxi). Dont allow strangers to assist you at ATMs, and keep your valuable documents in a safe place at all times. Cape Town Tourism also has some tips on their website.'
