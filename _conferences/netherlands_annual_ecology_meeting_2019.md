other_details: 'NERN is not a society, association or club and thus does not have members. It is a network of which all people working in ecology in the Netherlands can be part. Formally, the network is supported and driven by a collaboration of all Graduate Schools and institutes working in the field of ecology, evolution, and biodiversity.'
