Criteria  The following criteria must be met to be eligible for EMBL childcare: The child must be between 3 months and 3 years One or both parents must be registered participants to the corresponding conference If your child has special dietary needs, requires medicine or special nappies, this must be provided for the duration of the conference You must agree to the EMBL Kinderhaus Medical Guidelines Valid travel insurance is required (in addition to the EMBL visitors insurance that covers the child during the conference)  As childcare spaces are limited, registration will be on a first-come first-served basis. Your place can only be confirmed after payment of the registration fee. The children of conference participants who are registered for childcare at EMBL are covered by the EMBL liability insurance in the case that something should happen to them whilst under the care of the kindergarten teacher (e.g. if they fall or injure themselves). It is nevertheless required that the conference participants also arrange health or travel insurance for themselves and their child which is valid in Germany, and that covers them in the case of illness or accident in which they are at fault that takes place when the child is not in the EMBL childcare, or an accident that takes place off the EMBL premises.  We accept international bank transfers up to 8 weeks before the conference starts, after which we will only accept credit card payments made via our online payment system. NO visa support letters will be issued for the child until payment of the registration fee is confirmed.  Cancellation of any booked onsite childcare service should be submitted in writing or via email and is valid only with acknowledgement of receipt by the EMBL Course & Conference Office. Cancellation fees are dependent on the notice given. If cancellation occurs less than 7 days prior to the start of the booked childcare service, the cancellation fee is 100percent of the fee. If cancellation occurs between 7 days and 1 month prior to the start of the event, the cancellation fee is 50percent of the fee. Earlier than 1 month, a cancellation fee of EUR 50 will be charged or 50percent of the fee, whichever is the lower. If the onsite childcare service has been booked by the registration deadline of the event and a visa is not awarded in time to travel to the event, the full fee for the onsite childcare will be reimbursed. In this case, the visa rejection letter or proof that the visa application process has been initiated on time is required before reimbursement is processed. '
