The whole city is also rather children-friendly and kids are literally enjoying all aspects of life with their families. Breastfeeding in public is a well-established norm despite some recent discussion. The organizers will also provide a dedicated room for taking care of children’s needs. For those who wish to contact local childcare services, the following can be contacted. Participants are advised that July is the high holiday season in Norway, so contact with the childcare services should be made well in advance of the conference in order to ensure staff availability. The conference organizers are not endorsing or taking responsibility for the childcare providers.)'
