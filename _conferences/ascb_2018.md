The 4-foot by 8-foot pod is meant for individual use, but can fit more than one person, including mothers with infants, breast pumps, or luggage. One is positioned near the Concierge Desk on the Convention Center’s second level between Halls A and B and a second unit is located on the street level on the Broad and Arch Concourse.  2018: A nicely furnished permanent Infant Lounge is located in the Women’s restroom behind Starbucks in the Hall E Lobby of the San Diego Convention Center.
