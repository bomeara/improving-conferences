The Aim is to bring African students together to introduce them to a variety of research projects in computational biology, increase their awareness of the broad range of opportunities that exist in the field, and introduce them to some of the people leading this research internationally. The conference provides a great opportunity for students as it is preceded by bioinformatics workshops. Funding will support the registration, travel and accommodation of students. It will not cover visa fees, meals or subsistence.) '
