career_development: 'Yes (1. Student and Early Career Pop-Up Talks: Being a scientist is more than working in the lab, office, or field. We all have experiences, talents, and stories to share, and Student and Early Career Pop-Up Talks are the chance for you to share yours. Student and early career participants will get to convey their ideas in a creative and approachable format and have a chance to display something beyond the traditional scientific talk. Students and early career scientists give 5 minute, TED-style presentation on an Earth and space science topic youre passionate about. 2018 Pop-Up Talks included singing/dancing your science, a mental health monologue, an overview of current political influence on scientific career prospects, and much more.This years Pop-Up Talks are encouraged to address the following theme: "For a resilient scientist and planet."   2. Career Center Theatre: Whether you are a student or early-mid career professional, if you are considering employment outside of academia, this interactive workshop will familiarize you with resume essentials. A resume is a marketing tool that communicates how your experiences and strengths demonstrate your alignment for a particular job. It is a way for you to emphasize your assets as a positive first impression. How do you highlight knowledge gained through courses and apply them to real work experience? What criteria is important to include and is there a specific order? How do I format my resume and phrase my skills so I stand out from the other applicants?  3. Telling Stories about Science and Ourselves: When we want to increase visibility and connect with others about science, we need to humanize science and scientists. One of the best ways of doing this is through telling stories—about our own journeys as well as about our science. This session will be a quick introduction to story structure and elements, the power of including emotion, and the benefits and challenges of sharing stories of ourselves as well as our work.   4. How to get Involved this Election Year: 2020 is a critical year to ensure that science is a key issue in elections—in local, state, and national races. From climate change to ocean policy to environmental health and more, so many critical policy issues depend on strong science input. You can help ensure that science is part of the conversation as candidates discuss their platforms in the coming months. Whether you aren’t sure if you are ready to talk to candidates, or are looking for new ways to get more involved, this session will guide you with a number of different opportunities and leave you with a clear set of options to get involved this election year.   5. Hashtag Science: Science Communication through Social Media: Social media, for all its faults, has allowed scientists much greater reach, across scientific disciplines and beyond, and has helped foster new dialogues and communities. This session will discuss the benefits and challenges of social media (and its different outlets), ways to effectively incorporate multimedia, and how to develop powerful messages and campaigns that can reach many audiences.   6. CV 101: Employment in academia is very competitive. Whether you seek a research or teaching position, you will need a Curriculum Vitae (CV) rather than a resume. A CV is a detailed record that communicates how your skills, knowledge, and experiences demonstrate your alignment for a particular job and higher education institution. Discuss the differences between writing a resume and writing a CV. How are CVs formatted? What skills should be detailed? How do you customize your CV so your presentations, publications, or honors/awards are featured?   7. Networking and Career Tips 101: Join this interactive workshop on the best tips and tricks for networking and career planning.   8. Messaging to Policymakers: Science communication is a valuable skill that enables you to make a difference in the world. Communicating effectively to policymakers is a particularly effective way to effect change, and is no harder than any other science communication, with a little knowledge and practice. If you want to share your science with your city council, state senators, or even Presidential candidates, the approach is the same. Come learn how to effectively message to policymakers at this workshop. While the focus will be on U.S. policymakers, many of these tools can be used in other countries and we encourage attendees from any location.  9. Interviews 101: Whether you are seeking employment in academia or industry, all students, graduates, and jobseekers can benefit from learning best tips and tricks for successful interviewing. An interview is a conversation where both parties need information about the other. Both sides must engage and exchange information for the interaction to be successful. A resume or CV will demonstrate your technical skills but the interview is your chance to highlight your non-technical skills. How do you highlight your strengths and competencies? Ho do I describe skills that I could improve? If I have limited experience, how do I demonstrate that I am still qualified and eager to learn?   10. Resumes 101: Whether you are a student or early-mid career professional, if you are considering employment outside of academia, this interactive workshop will familiarize you with resume essentials. A resume is a marketing tool that communicates how your experiences and strengths demonstrate your alignment for a particular job. It is a way for you to emphasize your assets as a positive first impression. How do you highlight knowledge gained through courses and apply them to real work experience? What criteria is important to include and is there a specific order? How do I format my resume and phrase my skills so I stand out from the other applicants?   11. Can We Talk? Difficult Conversations with Underrepresented People of Color about Diversifying STEM Fields: Interactive session focusing on Social Belonging and Allyship: In this 2-hour workshop, participants will learn about two important components to STEM retention for underrepresented people of color (UR-POC), sense of belonging and allyship. Through the use of film and various interactive exercises, participants will explore how to create and support belonging for diverse groups within institutional settings and how to be an ally to UR-POC. Allies will learn how to understand their role/s and how to better support UR-POC when they are confronted with various obstacles ranging from psycho-emotional situations to systemic.)'
