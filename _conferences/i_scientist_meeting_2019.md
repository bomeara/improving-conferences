gender_balance: 'Yes, do not explicitly mention speaker equity but are inclusive of genders (Gender-star: In some places we use terms like "women*". Why do we do this, what does "women*" mean? The star/asterisk shall indicate that the terms "women" and "men" are constructs, and we question a binary classification of humans in either "women" or "men", and that we question all role allocations to "women" and "men" which many people still see as natural (women are more empathic and caring, men are good in technology, etc). In many contexts our gender should not matter at all, like e.g. at work, our gender should just be irrelevant; but thats not how our society works, everyone is often also judged based on their gender. So we question the binary classification, we question the "women are like this" -- "men are like that" but at the same time we acknowledge that our society is still organized like this and that based on the classification, assumptions and stereotypes women are marginalized, so therefore we believe that its still necessary to use the term "women", make women visible etc.)'
