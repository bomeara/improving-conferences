What does this grant cover? Each grant is intended to partially reimburse travel expenses (airfare, ground transportation, and/or hotel). Meals and the conference registration fee are NOT eligible for reimbursement. Grants typically range from $250-$500 USD per domestic traveler and $300-$750 USD per international traveler, but may be more or less, depending on the funds available.  Who is eligible? You must be a current SPIE Student Member when you apply, as well as when you present your paper. You must be a full-time student author in a high school, undergraduate, or graduate program, who will present your accepted paper at an SPIE conference and submit your manuscript to be published in the Proceedings of SPIE. You must submit your complete application and we must receive a letter of recommendation from your advisor or department head by the deadline.  Who is NOT eligible? Postdoctoral students (students who have completed their PhD, ScD, or MD program) are NOT eligible. If you have received an SPIE Student Author Travel Grant or MKS Instruments (formerly Newport) Research Excellence Travel Award for any SPIE meeting within the last 18 months, you are NOT eligible. If you have received an SPIE Officer Travel Grant this year, or within the last 18 months, you are NOT eligible.)'
