code_of_ethics: 'Note March 2020: CNS 2020 will proceed as a virtual conference later this spring, with the dates to be announced soon: It is not taking place on March 14-17, 2020. Virtual conference planning is progressing well, and more details are forthcoming. Deep thanks to the plenary and award speakers, symposia chairs, and speakers, as well as the CNS Trainee Association, who have overwhelmingly stepped up to provide their talks for the virtual meeting. We have contracted to use a single, professional virtual platform that presents the talks, symposia, and panels in a regular meeting style, including live chat and other options for interaction. Poster presenters will have high-quality customizable virtual poster booths where they can present their posters, including short optional video presentations and live chat. Exhibitors will have access to “exhibitor booths,” with options that include live chat and other methods for interaction.'
