caregiver_grant: 'Yes (Grants for Carers: Apply for up to £1,000 to help cover caring costs  Caring responsibilities are wide and varied, but we know they can sometimes be hard to balance alongside your career.  With our Grants for Carers, you can apply for up to £1,000 per year to help you attend a chemistry-related meeting, conference or workshop or a professional development event. This money would be used to cover any additional costs you incur, paying for care that you usually provide.   Each application will be assessed on its own merits  Every carers responsibilities are different, so we are committed to assessing each application individually. However, by way of guidance, the kinds of expenses that we will consider funding include:   extra home help or nursing care for a dependant whilst you will not be present  additional medical/respite care for a dependant whilst you will not be present  travel expenses to allow a relative to accompany you in order to care for your dependants whilst you attend a meeting or event  extended hours with a care worker/childminder/play scheme to allow you to return home later than normal.   You are eligible to apply if:  you are a chemist  you will incur additional caring expenses while attending a chemistry-related meeting, conference, workshop or professional development event  you will use these funds to cover the cost of care that you usually provide  you are based in the UK or Ireland or if not, you will normally have held three years RSC membership (either past or current).  We have designed the process to be straightforward and will ask you to provide brief details of the event and a description of how the grant will be used. We aim to respond to you within six weeks of your application.   To apply please complete the Grants for Carers application form.  Multiple applications, up to the maximum value of £1,000 per year, will be considered. All applications will be individually assessed at our discretion.  Please note that, if you receive a grant, you will need to complete a Grants for Carers return form and submit receipts after your attendance at the event.    Addressing inequality  These grants have been introduced following the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Breaking the barriers report which found that 78percent of chemists working in UK academia felt that managing parenting and/or caring responsibilities had an impact on women’s retention and progression. However, applications to this fund are not limited to female scientists – anyone with caring responsibilities is welcome to apply.  These grants have been supported by the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Chemists’ Community Fund.'

other_details: ' Phishing Warning We are aware that some speakers and delegates have been approached by companies claiming to operate on behalf of the Royal Society of Chemistry to book their travel and accommodation for our conferences. Please note that whilst we do sometimes work with accommodation providers in order to facilitate hotel bookings, they would never approach you in the first instance. Details of accommodation providers that we are working with are in the ‘accommodation’ section of this webpage.
