travel_awards: 'Yes (Yes (67 travel grants were awarded in 2019: The current program provides students up to $500 each to support their travel to the APA convention, to be held in Washington, D.C. in 2020. A handful of students who apply for a travel award will receive an Ungerleider/Zimbardo Travel Scholarship from the American Psychological Foundation. Applicants must have psychology as the primary focus of their graduate studies (even if they are receiving training in other fields as well). They should be enrolled full time and in good standing in their graduate programs. Applicants may be citizens or residents of any country and their institutions may be located and accredited/recognized in any country. Applicants must be student affiliates or associate members of APA (graduate student affiliates are automatically members of APAGS â€” see student affiliate application for details). Students who are not affiliates must apply for affiliation when submitting materials for the travel award; however, all materials must be received by the Science Directorate in a single, complete package. Research papers or posters must already have been accepted by an APA division for presentation. Students must be first author on the accepted research paper or poster. Multiple author submissions are acceptable, but the student applicant must be the designated presenter of the research. If there are multiple student authors, only the first author may apply for these funds. If the student applicant has been accepted to present more than one paper or poster, she or he must choose only one paper/poster presentation to use when applying for this award. Students who are designated presenters in a division-sponsored symposium are also eligible to apply for this award. Each psychology department (i.e., not individual programs within a department) may endorse no more than three students per year for the travel award. If more than three students from a department wish to apply for these funds, the department must perform an initial screening and forward only three applications. In addition to being eligible to apply for a travel award, students who are both members of APAGS and first authors are also eligible to have their convention registration fees waived. Further information about this potential fee waiver will be emailed to eligible students by early June.)'
