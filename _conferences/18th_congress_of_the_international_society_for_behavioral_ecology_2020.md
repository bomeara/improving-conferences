This would include an introduction to reproducibility, data management and data sharing, with practical exercises/information on platforms, such as Github, preprint servers and the OSF (open science framework). The workshop may also cover error detection (critical evaluation of published research and how to detect inconsistencies in data patterns).  2. The Mentor Program: The Congress provides a valuable opportunity to make connections and share knowledge and to facilitate this, the Organisers are offering a Mentor Program. This is simply an opportunity for you to catch up with your mentor/mentee over a coffee or  lunch break and have a conversation, share ideas, challenges and opportunities. There is no expectation beyond the opportunity for a chance to make a connection and share a conversation with a colleague who shares a similar interest. If you would like to be mentored or would be keen to be a mentor, please indicate your interest on the registration form and also your main subject area of interest. Closer to the time of the Congress, we will facilitate contact with your designated mentor/mentee so you can make arrangements to meet at your convenience during the Congress.)'
