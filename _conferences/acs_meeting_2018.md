We encourage inclusivity and oppose discrimination in scientific learning and practice based on - but not limited to - race, religion, country or ethnic origin, citizenship, language, political opinion, sex, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, and economic class in academic, industrial, and government workplaces. The Society believes that an enduring commitment to diversity enables excellence, innovation, and transformative action in current and future generations of chemical professionals. As a global scientific society, we affirm the international principles that the responsible practice of science, free from discrimination in all of its forms, is fundamental to scientific advancement and human wellbeing, as outlined by the International Council for Science’s (ICSU) Statute 51. We also affirm our commitment to a scientific environment that facilitates the execution and communication of scientific work with integrity, fairness, and transparency at all organizational levels. This extends to our general scientific endeavors—including our professional interactions and engagement with other scientists, trainees, and the general public. We recognize that harm to our profession, our scientific credibility, individual wellbeing, and society at large is caused by not doing so. To this end, the Society will implement the principles of diversity, inclusivity, and equity within ACS leadership and membership to build a community across the chemical enterprise. We are committed to quantifying and monitoring our diversity.)'
