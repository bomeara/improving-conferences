caregiver_grant: 'None'
career_development: 'Yes (1. Career Fair for graduate and postdoctoral trainees on job search 2. Junior Principal Investigator Sessions: A.How to outline an individualized career development plan to become a successful PI(This session will cover the concept of having an active role on your own career development and empowering trainees to have a strategy when picking mentors and pursuing training. This encompasses making very conscious decisions about what your niche or "brand" will be when looking for jobs (academic or not). Having an "IDP" is a requirement for all NIH grants on the "training" phases and it is also being requested by private foundations.)   B.Climbing the grant ladder: The importance of establishing a record of funding early in your career(Grantsmanship has a (steep) learning curve and the earlier you start to climb the better you will be by the time you really need to get funded. Starting a position with funding makes you extremely attractive in a job search, and it used to be exceptional but it is slowly becoming the norm. This session will go through the typical grant ladders available in the US and in Europe and provide tips on how to climb and how to help your trainees begin their journey.) C.Strategies to generate data: wet-lab, collaborations and consortia(As a computational person, having your own wetlab can be extremely beneficial providing you with experimental control and access to additional funding. However, is it wise to venture outside your area of expertise? Or is it better to rely on collaborations? How do you go about supervising PhDs in the wetlab if you have no experience yourself?)  Consortium projects can help you do bigger and better science. However, getting the most out of participation in a consortium and coming out on top can be difficult. D.How to get involved in the ISCB as a PI(The ISCB has expressed a desire to further engage senior postdocs and principal investigators in the society. In this session we will find out ways in which participants can become more active within the society.)   (How do you hire the best staff? How do you get tenure? What if you donâ€™t get tenure? How do you manage a budget? How much admin should I do? How much should you travel? How do you motivate lab members? These questions and many more will be discussed amongst participants and each will share their secrets on what has worked best. This will be achieved through structured round table conversations amongst participants with the speakers.)'
ecr_promotion_events: 'ISCB Student Council (https://www.iscbsc.org/) aim to promote the caree development of young computational biologists through their events. The Student Council conducts coordinated ECR events with ISCB-related events (ISMB, ECCB, ASBCB, ISCB-LA), such as the Student Council Symposium (SCS), European Student Council Symposium (ESCS), Student Council Symposium - Latin America (LA-SCS) and Student Council Symposium - Africa (SCS Africa). Also many student awards:Ian Lawson Van Toch Memorial Award for Outstanding Student Paper presented to two traineeas, F1000 Poster Awards presented to six trainees, RCSB and PDB Poster Prize presented to two trainees.'
travel_awards: 'Yes (ISCB provides Travel Fellowship funds exclusively for ISCB student and post doctoral members to attend the annual Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB), Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB), Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB), the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB), and APBioNets International Conference on Computational Biology (InCoB). With the exception of PSB which is regularly held the first week of January in Hawaii, these other conferences typically move around geographically each year, and each are separated by several weeks or several months so as not to overlap. If you are a student or post doc presenting a paper or poster at any of these conferences and you need travel support funds to attend the conference please complete the application process as outlined on each of the conference websites (see conference calendar for links to the respective upcoming conference websites). ISCB fellowships to the annual ISMB conference are primarily supported through grant funds from U.S. government agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE), and in some cases the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIH/NIGMS). When ISMB is held in conjunction with ECCB additional fellowship funding may be supported through European agencies. As a member society of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), all of ISCBs Society-run annual conferences, ISMB, Rocky, CSHALS, GLBIO, ISCB-Africa, ISCB-Asia, and ISCB-Latin America are also eligible for the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) travel fellowship program supported by a long- term grant from the NIH. The MARC funds are exclusively designated for minority scientists who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents (green card holders). Full information on the MARC funding program can be found on the FASEB website at www.faseb.org. Due to limited funds we regret that it is generally not possible to fund all travel fellowship applicants to the above conferences.) '
