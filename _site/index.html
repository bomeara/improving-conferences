All candidates must be eligible in one of the three applicant tiers AND meet training/post training limits as described below.  Candidates from underrepresented populations in science and medicine are highly encouraged to apply. Previous Travel Awardees are not eligible to apply.   APPLICANT TIERS Junior Level applicants are defined as those individuals who are below Assistant Professor or equivalent level if in a non-academic institution, i.e., trainees including psychiatric residents, Pharm.D. residents, interns, and post-doctoral fellows. These applicants may be no more than 5 years past final training (postdoctoral fellowship or residency). Post training for M.D.’s will be counted from the final year of their residency or fellowship. Post training for Pharm.D.’s will be counted from completion of Pharm.D. or residency if completed.  Post training for Ph.D.’s will be counted from the last year of postdoctoral fellowship.   Senior Level applicants are defined as those individuals who are at the Assistant Professor level or its equivalent, but not an R01 awardee.  Applicants may be no more than 5 years past their final training (postdoctoral fellowship or residency). Any person who is an Associate Professor or has already obtained an R01, is considered too senior to apply for a travel award. Post training for M.D.’s will be counted from the final year of their residency or fellowship. Post training for Pharm.D.’s will be counted from completion of Pharm.D. or residency if completed.  Post training for Ph.D.’s will be counted from the last year of postdoctoral fellowship.

Award: Up to $500 to defray travel costs to the meetings. Application and Essay: The essay question changes each year. Awards are made on the basis of an essay of no more than 750 words long (excluding references). Any submission over 750 words will be automatically disqualified. References are not counted towards the 750 words and should be included in the same text box with the essay. In 2019, the AAPA formally adopted a new position statement on race and racism (https://physanth.org/about/position-statements/aapa-statement-race-and-racism-2019/). The Association is uniquely positioned to offer such a statement, given the historical roles that biological anthropologists have played in the creation and perpetuation of racialized systems of oppression and discrimination. In our professional contexts, biological anthropologists have opportunities to address "race," educate students, and inform publics about the science of human biological variation. In an essay of 750 words or less, describe how you may approach such opportunities in the classroom or in other professional arenas, and how they can best be used to communicate an honest and accurate message concerning the science of race and racism. Essay evaluation and scoring procedures: The AAPA student prize committee will evaluate each submission with an identification number (assigned by the committee chair) to mask authors’ identities. Applicants who have won a Pollitzer travel award previously are eligible to enter the competition again, but students who have never won before will be given priority.)</td>

A handful of students who apply for a travel award will receive an Ungerleider/Zimbardo Travel Scholarship from the American Psychological Foundation. Applicants must have psychology as the primary focus of their graduate studies (even if they are receiving training in other fields as well). They should be enrolled full time and in good standing in their graduate programs.  Applicants may be citizens or residents of any country and their institutions may be located and accredited/recognized in any country.  Applicants must be student affiliates or associate members of APA (graduate student affiliates are automatically members of APAGS — see student affiliate application for details). Students who are not affiliates must apply for affiliation when submitting materials for the travel award; however, all materials must be received by the Science Directorate in a single, complete package.  Research papers or posters must already have been accepted by an APA division for presentation.  Students must be first author on the accepted research paper or poster. Multiple author submissions are acceptable, but the student applicant must be the designated presenter of the research. If there are multiple student authors, only the first author may apply for these funds. If the student applicant has been accepted to present more than one paper or poster, she or he must choose only one paper/poster presentation to use when applying for this award.  Students who are designated presenters in a division-sponsored symposium are also eligible to apply for this award. Each psychology department (i.e., not individual programs within a department) may endorse no more than three students per year for the travel award. If more than three students from a department wish to apply for these funds, the department must perform an initial screening and forward only three applications. In addition to being eligible to apply for a travel award, students who are both members of APAGS and first authors are also eligible to have their convention registration fees waived. Further information about this potential fee waiver will be emailed to eligible students by early June.)</td>

With the exception of PSB which is regularly held the first week of January in Hawaii, these other conferences typically move around geographically each year, and each are separated by several weeks or several months so as not to overlap. If you are a student or post doc presenting a paper or poster at any of these conferences and you need travel support funds to attend the conference please complete the application process as outlined on each of the conference websites (see conference calendar for links to the respective upcoming conference websites). ISCB fellowships to the annual ISMB conference are primarily supported through grant funds from U.S. government agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE), and in some cases the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIH/NIGMS). When ISMB is held in conjunction with ECCB additional fellowship funding may be supported through European agencies. As a member society of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), all of ISCBs Society-run annual conferences, ISMB, Rocky, CSHALS, GLBIO, ISCB-Africa, ISCB-Asia, and ISCB-Latin America are also eligible for the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) travel fellowship program supported by a long- term grant from the NIH. The MARC funds are exclusively designated for minority scientists who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents (green card holders). Full information on the MARC funding program can be found on the FASEB website at www.faseb.org. Due to limited funds we regret that it is generally not possible to fund all travel fellowship applicants to the above conferences.) </td>
