This is a small, informal workshop, which will provide lots of opportunity to get to know fellow VALIDATE post-docs/post-grads from around the world. The workshop will be run as part of the VALIDATE Network 2019 Annual Meeting and is a follow-on workshop to our 2018 ECR workshop, and so will contain different information to 2018. Agenda This one day workshop will include sessions about career planning for success, how to communicate your research effectively, grant writing, and leadership, as well as our highly successful career panel Q&A of senior members of VALIDAT. This session will discuss how to plan effectively for career success, and guide you through some exercises and questions to get you thinking and planning your next career steps. Managing yourself: great leadership  As you step up in your career into roles requiring management, particularly as a Group Leader, how can you be a Leader who inspires, motivates and supports your team to success? How to communicate well around vaccine research  With extensive experience in communications around vaccines, particularly the Ebola vaccine trials in Africa, we will discuss best practice in communicating your research, the risks and pitfalls that can occur with vaccines, and how to deal well with these. Career planning for success  Senior members of VALIDATE from different walks of the post post-doc career trajectory will give short talks about their careers, tips and advice for our ECRs, and then answer questions from our audience about having a successful career in science Planning and writing a great grant application  As a senior and successful academic researcher, will talk us through how to plan and write a great grant application – from finding your initial scientific idea and finding collaborators, through to what funders are looking for, how to write well, tips for success, and insights from the various review panels she’s sat on.)</p>
