  <p><b> Caregiver grant:</b> Yes (To support the FENS 2020 attendance of ambitious scientists with children, the FENS-Kavli Network will provide a limited number of childcare grants. Successful applicants will receive 400 Euros which can be spent flexibly on extra childcare at home, travel of kids and carer to FENS or travel of a carer to your home for childcare during the FENS Forum 2020.

Members of both networks – the ALBA Network and The FENS-Kavli Network of Excellence – will also be sharing their own experience with negotiating in their career.     2. Starting and mid-career PI hurdles: During the evening session – workshop format – several round tables will be organised simultaneously, and the afore-mentioned topics from the lunch seminar session will be discussed in-depth between the FKNE Scholars and alumni, and selected participants.

ALBA-FKNE Diversity Prize: With this Diversity prize, The ALBA Network and the The FENS-Kavli Scholars wish to highlight a scientist or group that has made outstanding contributions to promoting equality and diversity in brain sciences. The promotion of equality and diversity — e.g. by gender, race, sexual orientation, class, or culture— in research depends upon leaders and role models that catalyse a full integration of all scientists across academic levels. This annual award will recognise an individual or group that has made outstanding contributions to this effort, including but not limited to advocacy, mentorship or the creation of diversity-promoting initiatives. This prize will be awarded by the ALBA and FKNE networks, annually, at either the FENS Forum or the FENS Regional Meetings (FRM). Prize: The awardee will receive €2000 and financial support to cover travel and participation for one person in the conference where the prize will be awarded (up to an additional €2000, depending on actual costs). Procedures: Both nomination of someone else or a group of individuals and self-nomination are encouraged. Nominations should include a statement (max. 1 page) indicating the merits of the nominee or group on promoting equality and diversity in the field of brain sciences and any relevant activities organised by the nominee or group to contribute to this goal. Eligibility: Brain science researchers at any career stage working at least 50percent in a European institution or brain science research institution or group of eligible individuals based in Europe.) (2. The FENS-Kavli Network of Excellence PhD Thesis Prize is awarded every second year and honors a young neuroscientist for his/her outstanding PhD thesis in any domain of neuroscience. Personal prize money: 2.000 €. Eligibility     the PhD must have been conducted in a FENS member country;     the candidate must have successfully defended his/her PhD thesis at the home institution;     at the time of the submission, no more than two years may have elapsed since the PhD was awarded;     the candidate must have at least one first-author manuscript published or accepted for publication. In case of a co-first authorship, the contribution of the applicant must be clearly stated on the publication, and can be further outlined in an accompanying document;     the candidate has to be available to attend the FENS Forum 2020 (Glasgow, 11-15 July)   </p>
