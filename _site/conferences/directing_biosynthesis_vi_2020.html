These grants have been supported by The Royal Society of Chemistry’s Chemists’ Community Fund.  Caring responsibilities are wide and varied, and so each application will be individually assessed, examples of applications that we will consider include:      paying for extra home help or nursing care for a dependent whilst you will not be present     additional medical/respite care for a dependent whilst you will not be present     travel expenses for a relative to travel with you to care for dependents whilst you attend a meeting or event     paying for extended hours with a care worker/childminder/play scheme to cover time when you will arrive home later than normal.)</p>

  <p><b> Other details:</b>  Phishing Warning We are aware that some speakers and delegates have been approached by companies claiming to operate on behalf of the Royal Society of Chemistry to book their travel and accommodation for our conferences. Please note that whilst we do sometimes work with accommodation providers in order to facilitate hotel bookings, they would never approach you in the first instance. Details of accommodation providers that we are working with are in the ‘accommodation’ section of this webpage.
