  <p><b> ECR promotion:</b> Yes (1.This year at ESA we are hosting our first ever Queer mixer: Queer people in science face particular challenges, whether that be working in locations that are unsafe and intolerant of LGBT+ individuals, or being in a work environment that is dominated by cis- and heteronormativity. There is increasing awareness of the underrepresentation of minorities in the sciences. Recognising this inequality is the first step to meeting the challenge of enhancing diversity and inclusivity in science. A 2013 survey (Yoder and Mattheis 2016) of people in STEM fields found that 40percent of LGBTQ+ identified respondents are not out to their colleagues. This is not the culture we strive for in ecology, and not within ESA. Enhancing the visibility of LGBTQ+ people (umbrella term for non-heterosexual or cisgender individuals: Queer) in ecology is important to enhancing the inclusive and diverse culture of the scientific field in Australia. ESA is in the position to influence the broader community of ecologists and ecology-related fields in Australia. Modelling off of the success of the British Ecological Society (BES) LGBT+ network and mixers (https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/membership-community/diversity/) , we will host a Queer mixer at ESA19 in Launceston.          2.Equity or Diversity Concerns? – You’ve got an Ally! We are striving to improve Equity and Diversity within ESA (and elsewhere) via our Equity and Diversity Policy and the addition of the Conference Code of Conduct. On a more personal level though, we want to provide a safe space for our members and conference attendees to raise issues outside of formal pathways, because often, the best time to say something is now! ESA has nominated a team of Equity and Diversity Allies at the 2019 conference to provide support for members who may have an equity and/or diversity issue, and to provide an avenue to lodge feedback or a complaint. If you would like to talk to someone please seek out one of the people listed below (look for the rainbow lanyard!). If you can’t find them, just ask at the ESA booth and we will help link you up. We can guarantee that any conversations will be handled with understanding and confidentiality.Interested in joining or contributing to the Equity & Diversity Working Group? Contact Gail at the ESA Booth.)</p>
  <p><b> Travel awards:</b> Yes (The ESA encourages student attendance at its annual conference by providing a number of student travel grants each year. Every student who applies for the grant and meets the criteria (until the allocation is exhausted) will receive some level of funding depending on the geographic location of their home campus (funding amounts shown below). The grants will be awarded in the order they were received once abstract confirmations have been sent out, you are welcome to apply beforehand, but will not be awarded a grant if your abstract is not accepted. ​ The amount of the grant received will be based on relative travel costs of all applicants, and are generally determined on the basis of relative costs of air travel. In addition to the usual travel grants, up to five extra travel grants (Wiley Student Fellowships) will be sponsored by Wiley Publishing. These fellowships will be awarded to individuals from the pool of applicants who have the highest travel costs. To be eligible for a student travel grant, applicants must be a member of the Society, be the presenting author of a talk or poster, and not have previously won a travel grant from the Society.)</p>
