It feels selfish to ramble about personal accomplishments in an interview. However, landing a job requires personal advocacy, so visit our lunch and learn to finally get comfortable building and selling your brand!) 2. Funding Opportunities at the National Science Foundation (The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides many opportunities for funding basic research and training in ecology, evolution, behavior, physiology, collections, and a variety of related disciplines. Covered topics will include the no deadline model, the Rules of Life track within the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and other funding opportunities)  3. Navigating Cultural Diversity in Scientific Research, Education, and Leadership (With the growing importance of diversity and inclusivity in various professional fields, there is a need to educate students and early professionals for a successful career. The goal of our session is to facilitate discussions with professionals in academia and industry with the experience in a culturally diverse workplace.)  4. How to Advocate for Your Publications(As the amount of research published increases each year, individual scientists have the power to cut through the clutter and advocate for the importance and interest of their work. Learn how your peers have successfully promoted their publications and gain the tools and skills you need to do the same.)  5.Getting Your Foot in the Door for Section Leadership Positions(Interested in getting more involved in the SysEB Section? Join current SysEB Section Governing Council members to learn more about their roles, responsibilities, and in-roads to leadership. The Governing Council will also serve as a panel to answer any questions from attendees.)  6. So, You’re on the Academic Job Market: Drafting Memorable Statements, Secrets from the  Search Committee, and Advice from Recent Hires(Applying for academic jobs? Seeking guidance from entomologists who have gone through the process recently? Then join us as we cover preparing your application materials (curriculum vitae, plus teaching, research, and diversity statements), the phone interview, the on-campus interview, and insider information on how search committees review applicants.)  7. What’s Your Story? Tips and Tricks for Telling Compelling Entomology(This session will explore the art of sharing your entomological expertise through non-scientific writing taught. Attendees will learn how to write captivating stories, both fiction and nonfiction, to share our science with a general audience.)</p>

Travel awards provide funding for student fieldwork and/or research travel to other institutions to enhance research projects. Successful proposals from graduate students will be funded through support from the SysEB Section; top-ranked proposals from graduate students will be recognized and funded separately by the SysEB Student Research Endowment (SRE). Typical award amounts are approximately $1,000-$1,500. Payment of the award will occur upon completion of travel as reimbursement. Students must provide evidence of travel (copy of boarding pass, hotel receipts, etc.) and copies of collecting and export permits (if applicable). Travel must be completed within a year of the award date.)</p>
