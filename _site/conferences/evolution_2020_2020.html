The Software Bazaar is free to participate.)                   three more days of workshops here: https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/workshops-and-special-events.html</p>
  <p><b> ECR promotion:</b> Yes (A) Graduate Student Mayr and Hamilton awards: Students who are members of the Society for the Study of Evolution or the Society of Systematic Biologists may be eligible to apply for the SSEs Hamilton Award or the SSBs Ernst Mayr Award during talk submission until the early registration deadline (April 15, 2020) or until all talk slots fill. Consult the society pages linked above for eligibility criteria. Those planning to apply should sign up early for a Regular Contributed Talk, because once these slots fill, it will no longer be possible to apply for these awards. If your application is successful, you will speak in either the Mayr or Hamilton Award Symposium; if not, your talk will be scheduled during the regular concurrent sessions. Applicants will be informed the outcome of the selection process by May 15 at the latest. Talk submission is only available after your main registration has been completed.  (B)Ruth Patrick Student Poster award: The Ruth Patrick Student Poster Award was established in 2012 to recognize a student member of the American Society of Naturalists who has presented an outstanding poster at the annual meeting. Student members can indicate their eligibility for this award if they submit a poster before the early registration deadline (April 15, 2020). Ruth Patrick was a renowned limnologist, past president of the ASN (1975), and a Lifetime Honorary Member of the society. The winner of the award receives $1,000. Students will be asked to indicate their eligibility for this award during the poster submission process. Poster submission is only available after your main registration has been completed.)     (2. Evolutionary Biologists with Disabilities and Allies Coffee Mixer: Description​: Interested in meeting fellow evolutionary biologists with disabilities, chronic illness, Deaf folks, and interested allies?
