  <p><b> Conference year:</b> 2018</p>
  <p><b> Disciplines:</b> Systems Biology, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics</p>
  <p><b> Total years:</b> 26</p>
  <p><b> Society name:</b> ISMB (Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology)</p>
  <p><b> Society members:</b> 3,400</p>
  <p><b> Attendees:</b> 1,500</p>
  <p><b> Venues:</b> International/Switzerland</p>
  <p><b> Frequency:</b> Annual</p>
  <p><b> Sponsors:</b> </p>
  <p><b> Is virtual?:</b> None</p>
  <p><b> Digital archives:</b> Select talks (https://www.youtube.com/c/ISCBScienceonDemand): Live-steaming (and rebroadcast) of the ISMB/ECCB 2019 Distinguished Keynotes ISCB proudly presents the live video-casting of the ISMB/ECCB 2019 keynote speakers. ISCB members who are unable to attend the flagship conference can watch the keynotes complimentary. Nonmembers can register for the ISMB/ECCB 2019 live broadcast for $250 USD. ISCB will be live broadcasting the keynotes daily at the scheduled program time and will re-broadcast the presentation at 6:00 PM CET. The ISCB Distinguished Keynote on Sunday, July 21 and presentation of the Accomplishments by a Senior Scientist Award and keynote will be broadcasted at its programmed time with no re-broadcast. Registration to this event gives access to both the live broadcast and the rebroadcast of the sessions.</p>
  <p><b> Cost:</b>  $2000-$4000</p>
  <p><b> Registration fee:</b>  $500-1500</p>
  <p><b> Carbon footprint:</b> 2250</p>
  <p><b> Other carbon footprint:</b> 450</p>
  <p><b> Program:</b> Conference App and .pdf of program book</p>
  <p><b> On-site maternity:</b> Yes (A private room is available during the conference for nursing mothers and others with sensitive personal needs. Staff at the registration desk will direct you to the room. Please note that this room is not staffed and contains tables, chairs, and a waste basket. A restroom is located nearby.)</p>
  <p><b> Childcare:</b> None-Off-site at a charge ( ISCB is unfortunately unable to provide childcare services. Attendees are encouraged to contact their hotel concierge to arrange individual or group childcare. Please check with your hotel well in advance of your arrival date. Child Care options are available through the following companies and are independent of ISCB and the ISMB conference: American Childcare: https://www.americanchildcare.com/contact.htm Sitters Studio: http://www.sittersstudio.com  College Nannies and Tutors: https://www.collegenanniesandtutors.com/office/state/IL)</p>
  <p><b> Caregiver grant:</b> None </p>
  <p><b> Career development:</b> Yes: 1. Career Fair for graduate and postdoctoral trainees on job search 2. Junior Principal Investigator Sessions: A.How to outline an individualized career development plan to become a successful PI(This session will cover the concept of having an active role on your own career development and empowering trainees to have a strategy when picking mentors and pursuing training. This encompasses making very conscious decisions about what your niche or "brand" will be when looking for jobs (academic or not). Having an "IDP" is a requirement for all NIH grants on the "training" phases and it is also being requested by private foundations.)   B.Climbing the grant ladder: The importance of establishing a record of funding early in your career(Grantsmanship has a (steep) learning curve and the earlier you start to climb the better you will be by the time you really need to get funded. Starting a position with funding makes you extremely attractive in a job search, and it used to be exceptional but it is slowly becoming the norm. This session will go through the typical grant ladders available in the US and in Europe and provide tips on how to climb and how to help your trainees begin their journey.) C.Strategies to generate data: wet-lab, collaborations and consortia(As a computational person, having your own wetlab can be extremely beneficial providing you with experimental control and access to additional funding. However, is it wise to venture outside your area of expertise? Or is it better to rely on collaborations? How do you go about supervising PhDs in the wetlab if you have no experience yourself?)  Consortium projects can help you do bigger and better science. However, getting the most out of participation in a consortium and coming out on top can be difficult. D.How to get involved in the ISCB as a PI(The ISCB has expressed a desire to further engage senior postdocs and principal investigators in the society. In this session we will find out ways in which participants can become more active within the society.)   (How do you hire the best staff? How do you get tenure? What if you donâ€™t get tenure? How do you manage a budget? How much admin should I do? How much should you travel? How do you motivate lab members? These questions and many more will be discussed amongst participants and each will share their secrets on what has worked best. This will be achieved through structured round table conversations amongst participants with the speakers.)</p>
  <p><b> ECR promotion:</b> 2 student awards:Ian Lawson Van Toch Memorial Award for Outstanding Student Paper presented to two traineeas, F1000 Poster Awards presented to six trainees, RCSB and PDB Poster Prize presented to two trainees.</p>
  <p><b> Travel awards:</b> Yes (ISCB provides Travel Fellowship funds exclusively for ISCB student and post doctoral members to attend the annual Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB), Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB), Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB), the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB), and APBioNets International Conference on Computational Biology (InCoB). With the exception of PSB which is regularly held the first week of January in Hawaii, these other conferences typically move around geographically each year, and each are separated by several weeks or several months so as not to overlap. If you are a student or post doc presenting a paper or poster at any of these conferences and you need travel support funds to attend the conference please complete the application process as outlined on each of the conference websites (see conference calendar for links to the respective upcoming conference websites). ISCB fellowships to the annual ISMB conference are primarily supported through grant funds from U.S. government agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy (DOE), and in some cases the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIH/NIGMS). When ISMB is held in conjunction with ECCB additional fellowship funding may be supported through European agencies. As a member society of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), all of ISCBs Society-run annual conferences, ISMB, Rocky, CSHALS, GLBIO, ISCB-Africa, ISCB-Asia, and ISCB-Latin America are also eligible for the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) travel fellowship program supported by a long- term grant from the NIH. The MARC funds are exclusively designated for minority scientists who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents (green card holders). Full information on the MARC funding program can be found on the FASEB website at www.faseb.org. Due to limited funds we regret that it is generally not possible to fund all travel fellowship applicants to the above conferences.) </p>
